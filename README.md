ResumeForMacOS
----

This is my resume as a macOS application.

# How it works

You basically just donwload the sources, run them in Xcode and then you see the CV. I will make a signed release at some point just for the fun of it – but that is for a later day.

> The resume can be exported to PDF from the app.
